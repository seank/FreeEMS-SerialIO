TODO WHEN BUILDING THE LOADER CHECK FOR LIB UPDATES

Finally I found the solution after finding the right words to search for.
The main problem was that the QMake created Makefiles did not check for the
"static" library as a dependency of the target. I solved this by adding

PRE_TARGETDEPS += "path/to/my/libRary.a"

To the project file. With that the binary gets relinked, when there were changes in the library.

Additionally I setup each project in eclipse to reference the dependent projects
 (Project properties -> Project References) to trigger rebuilds if necessary.
